<h2>Strategies for picking the best stocks to buy</h2>
There are scores of money-making options available of which knowing how to pick the <strong>best stocks to buy</strong> is one of the important ones. You just need to be aware of the right strategies to make money from stock investments. Listed below are four techniques which have earned investors great returns in the past few decades: 
<ul>
    <li>Purchase stocks with low P/E ratio: Companies with low price-earnings ratio usually make more profit from investments of traders, than the ones with higher P/E ratios. It is the tendency of the market to reward the companies with high P/E which it expects to make strong profit growth. However, the only problem is that the market often gets it calculations entirely wrong, as it backs up popular growth stocks while writing off the solid and successful companies. A few recent studies have established the fact that the people who have invested in stocks with low P/E have earned much greater returns when compared to the ones who invested in high P/E stocks. </li>
    <li>Purchase stocks that pay big dividends: This idea might sound a bit too simple to be true in the first instance, but the fact of the matter is that quite a few studies on stock markets have actually demonstrated that companies with the largest dividend-paying stocks provided investors with more investment returns in comparison to those with lower dividend stocks.</li>
    <li>Purchase companies priced below book value: If you want to find the real worth of a company, then take a look at its net asset value. While most companies trade above their asset value, it is this very element that supports them during tough financial and economic situations. There are companies, however, which trade below their asset values. Investors who have opted for such stocks have often beaten the ones with higher rating. </li>
    <li>Small Caps v/s Blue Chips: ‘Elephants don’t gallop’ is one of the popular sayings in the stock markets, and it holds true for blue-chip companies as well. The reason behind it is that most of these dominant companies are already attained maturity in the industry, which in turn diminishes the chances of rapid growths in quick succession. Small cap companies, in contrast, have the possibility of providing lucrative returns in a developing market. </li>
</ul>
So, just keep these proven investment strategies in mind while beginning your search for the best <strong>stocks to buy</strong> in the market to get assured returns.
